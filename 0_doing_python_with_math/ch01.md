Let's take our first steps toward using Python to explore the world of
math and science. We'll keep it simple now so you can get a handle on
using Python itself. We'll start by performing basic mathematical
operations, and then we'll write simple programs for manipulating and
understanding numbers. Let's get started!

### **Basic Mathematical Operations**

The *Python interactive shell* is going to be our friend in this book.
Start the Python 3 IDLE shell and say "hello" (see [Figure
1-1](ch01.html#ch1fig1)) by typing [print(\'Hello IDLE\')]{.literal} and
then pressing [ENTER]{.small}. (For instructions on how to install
Python and start IDLE, see [Appendix A](app01.html#app01).) IDLE obeys
your command and prints the words back to the screen.
Congratulations---you just wrote a program!

When you see the [\>\>\>]{.literal} prompt again, IDLE is ready for more
instructions.

[]{#ch1fig1}*Figure 1-1: Python 3 IDLE shell*

Python can act like a glorified calculator, doing simple computations.
Just type an expression and Python will evaluate it. After you press
[ENTER]{.small}, the result appears immediately.

Give it a try. You can add and subtract numbers using the addition
([+]{.literal}) and subtraction ([--]{.literal}) operators. For example:

```python
\>\>\> [1 + 2]{.codestrong}\
3\
\>\>\> [1 + 3.5]{.codestrong}\
4.5\
\>\>\> [-1 + 2.5]{.codestrong}\
1.5\
\>\>\> [100 -- 45]{.codestrong}\
55\
\>\>\> [-1.1 + 5]{.codestrong}\
3.9
```

To multiply, use the multiplication ([\*]{.literal}) operator:

\>\>\> [3 \* 2]{.codestrong}\
6\
\>\>\> [3.5 \* 1.5]{.codestrong}\
5.25

To divide, use the division ([/]{.literal}) operator:

\>\>\> [3 / 2]{.codestrong}\
1.5\
\>\>\> [4 / 2]{.codestrong}\
2.0

As you can see, when you ask Python to perform a division operation, it
returns the fractional part of the number as well. If you want the
result in the form of an integer, with any decimal values removed, you
should use the floor division ([//]{.literal}) operator:

\>\>\> [3 // 2]{.codestrong}\
1

[]{#page_3}The floor division operator divides the first number by the
second number and then rounds down the result to the next lowest
integer. This becomes interesting when one of the numbers is negative.
For example:

\>\>\> [-3 // 2]{.codestrong}\
-2

The final result is the integer lower than the result of the division
operation ([-3/2 = -1.5]{.literal}, so the final result is
[-2]{.literal}).

On the other hand, if you want just the remainder, you should use the
modulo ([%]{.literal}) operator:

\>\>\> [9 % 2]{.codestrong}\
1

You can calculate the power of numbers using the exponential
([\*\*]{.literal}) operator. The examples below illustrate this:

\>\>\> [2 \*\* 2]{.codestrong}\
4\
\>\>\> [2 \*\* 10]{.codestrong}\
1024\
\>\>\> [1 \*\* 10]{.codestrong}\
1

We can also use the exponential symbol to calculate powers less than 1.
For example, the square root of a number *n* can be expressed as
*n*^1/2^ and the cube root as *n*^1/3^:

\>\>\> [8 \*\* (1/3)]{.codestrong}\
2.0

As this example shows, you can use parentheses to combine mathematical
operations into more complicated expressions. Python will evaluate the
expression following the standard *PEMDAS* rule for the order of
calculations---parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division,
addition, and subtraction. Consider the following two expressions---one
without parentheses and one with:

\>\>\> [5 + 5 \* 5]{.codestrong}\
30\
\>\>\> [(5 + 5) \* 5]{.codestrong}\
50

In the first example, Python calculates the multiplication first: 5
times 5 is 25; 25 plus 5 is 30. In the second example, the expression
within the parentheses is evaluated first, just as we'd expect: 5 plus 5
is 10; 10 times 5 is 50.

These are the absolute basics of manipulating numbers in Python. Let's
now learn how we can assign names to numbers.

### []{#page_4}**Labels: Attaching Names to Numbers** {#ch01lev1sec02 .h3}

As we start designing more complex Python programs, we'll assign names
to numbers---at times for convenience, but mostly out of necessity.
Here's a simple example:

[➊]{.ent} \>\>\> [a = 3]{.codestrong}\
   \>\>\> [a + 1]{.codestrong}\
   4\
[➋]{.ent} \>\>\> [a = 5]{.codestrong}\
   \>\>\> [a + 1]{.codestrong}\
   6

At [➊]{.ent}, we assign the name [a]{.literal} to the number 3. When we
ask Python to evaluate the result of the expression [a + 1]{.literal},
it sees that the number that [a]{.literal} refers to is 3, and then it
adds 1 and displays the output (4). At [➋]{.ent}, we change the value of
[a]{.literal} to 5, and this is reflected in the second addition
operation. Using the name [a]{.literal} is convenient because you can
simply change the number that [a]{.literal} points to and Python uses
this new value when [a]{.literal} is referred to anywhere after that.

This kind of name is called a *label*. You may have been introduced to
the term *variable* to describe the same idea elsewhere. However,
considering that *variable* is also a mathematical term (used to refer
to something like *x* in the equation *x* + 2 = 3), in this book I use
the term *variable* only in the context of mathematical equations and
expressions.

### **Different Kinds of Numbers** {#ch01lev1sec03 .h3}

You may have noticed that I've used two kinds of numbers to demonstrate
the mathematical operations---numbers without a decimal point, which you
already know as *integers*, and numbers with a decimal point, which
programmers call *floating point numbers*. We humans have no trouble
recognizing and working with numbers whether they're written as
integers, floating point decimals, fractions, or roman numerals. But in
some of the programs that we write in this book, it will only make sense
to perform a task on a particular type of number, so we'll often have to
write a bit of code to have the programs check whether the numbers we
input are of the right type.

Python considers integers and floating point numbers to be different
*types*. If you use the function [type()]{.literal}, Python will tell
you what kind of number you've just input. For example:

\>\>\> [type(3)]{.codestrong}\
\<class \'int\'\>\
\
\>\>\> [type(3.5)]{.codestrong}\
\<class \'float\'\>\
\
\>\>\> [type(3.0)]{.codestrong}\
\<class \'float\'\>

[]{#page_5}Here, you can see that Python classifies the number 3 as an
integer (type [\'int\']{.literal}) but classifies 3.0 as a floating
point number (type [\'float\']{.literal}). We all know that 3 and 3.0
are mathematically equivalent, but in many situations, Python will treat
these two numbers differently because they are two different types.

Some of the programs we write in this chapter will work properly only
with an integer as an input. As we just saw, Python won't recognize a
number like 1.0 or 4.0 as an integer, so if we want to accept numbers
like that as valid input in these programs, we'll have to convert them
from floating point numbers to integers. Luckily, there's a function
built in to Python that does just that:

\>\>\> [int(3.8)]{.codestrong}\
3\
\>\>\> [int(3.0)]{.codestrong}\
3

The function [int()]{.literal} takes the input floating point number,
gets rid of anything that comes after the decimal point, and returns the
resulting integer. The [float()]{.literal} function works similarly to
perform the reverse conversion:

\>\>\> [float(3)]{.codestrong}\
3.0

[float()]{.literal} takes the integer that was input and adds a decimal
point to turn it into a floating point number.

#### ***Working with Fractions*** {#ch01lev2sec01 .h4}

Python can also handle fractions, but to do that, we'll need to use
Python's [fractions]{.literal} module. You can think of a *module* as a
program written by someone else that you can use in your own programs. A
module can include classes, functions, and even label definitions. It
can be part of Python's standard library or distributed from a
third-party location. In the latter case, you would have to install the
module before you could use it.

The [fractions]{.literal} module is part of the standard library,
meaning that it's already installed. It defines a class
[Fraction]{.literal}, which is what we'll use to enter fractions into
our programs. Before we can use it, we'll need to *import* it, which is
a way of telling Python that we want to use the class from this module.
Let's see a quick example---we'll create a new label, [f]{.literal},
which refers to the fraction 3/4:

[➊]{.ent} \>\>\> [from fractions import Fraction]{.codestrong}\
[➋]{.ent} \>\>\> [f = Fraction(3, 4)]{.codestrong}\
[➌]{.ent} \>\>\> [f]{.codestrong}\
   Fraction(3, 4)

We first import the [Fraction]{.literal} class from the
[fractions]{.literal} module [➊]{.ent}. Next, we create an object of
this class by passing the numerator and []{#page_6}denominator as
parameters [➋]{.ent}. This creates a [Fraction]{.literal} object for the
fraction 3/4. When we print the object [➌]{.ent}, Python displays the
fraction in the form [Fraction([numerator]{.codeitalic},
[denominator]{.codeitalic})]{.literal}.

The basic mathematical operations, including the comparison operations,
are all valid for fractions. You can also combine a fraction, an
integer, and a floating point number in a single expression:

\>\>\> [Fraction(3, 4) + 1 + 1.5]{.codestrong}\
3.25

When you have a floating point number in an expression, the result of
the expression is returned as a floating point number.

On the other hand, when you have only a fraction and an integer in the
expression, the result is a fraction, even if the result has a
denominator of 1.

\>\>\> [Fraction(3, 4) + 1 + Fraction(1/4)]{.codestrong}\
Fraction(2, 1)

Now you know the basics of working with fractions in Python. Let's move
on to a different kind of number.

#### ***Complex Numbers*** {#ch01lev2sec02 .h4}

The numbers we've seen so far are the so-called *real numbers*. Python
also supports *complex numbers* with the imaginary part identified by
the letter *j* or *J* (as opposed to the letter *i* used in mathematical
notation). For example, the complex number 2 + 3*i* would be written in
Python as 2 + 3*j*:

\>\>\> [a = 2 + 3j]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [type(a)]{.codestrong}\
\<class \'complex\'\>

As you can see, when we use the [type()]{.literal} function on a complex
number, Python tells us that this is an object of type
[complex]{.literal}.

You can also define complex numbers using the [complex()]{.literal}
function:

\>\>\> [a = complex(2, 3)]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [a]{.codestrong}\
(2 + 3j)

Here we pass the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as two
arguments to the [complex()]{.literal} function, and it returns a
complex number.

You can add and subtract complex numbers in the same way as real
numbers:

\>\>\> [b = 3 + 3j]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [a + b]{.codestrong}\
(5 + 6j)\
\>\>\> [a - b]{.codestrong}\
(-1 + 0j)

[]{#page_7}Multiplication and division of complex numbers are also
carried out similarly:

\>\>\> [a \* b]{.codestrong}\
(-3 + 15j)\
\>\>\> [a / b]{.codestrong}\
(0.8333333333333334 + 0.16666666666666666j)

The modulus ([%]{.literal}) and the floor division ([//]{.literal})
operations are not valid for complex numbers.

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be retrieved using
its [real]{.literal} and [imag]{.literal} attributes, as follows:

\>\>\> [z = 2 + 3j]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [z.real]{.codestrong}\
2.0\
\>\>\> [z.imag]{.codestrong}\
3.0

The *conjugate* of a complex number has the same real part but an
imaginary part with an equal magnitude and an opposite sign. It can be
obtained using the [conjugate()]{.literal} method:

\>\>\> [z.conjugate()]{.codestrong}\
(2 - 3j)

Both the real and imaginary parts are floating point numbers. Using the
real and imaginary parts, you can then calculate the *magnitude* of a
complex number with the following formula, where *x* and *y* are the
real and imaginary parts of the number, respectively:
![image](graphics/e0007-01.jpg). In Python, this would look like the
following:

\>\>\> [(z.real \*\* 2 + z.imag \*\* 2) \*\* 0.5]{.codestrong}\
3.605551275463989

A simpler way to find the magnitude of a complex number is with the
[abs()]{.literal} function. The [abs()]{.literal} function returns the
absolute value when called with a real number as its argument. For
example, [abs(5)]{.literal} and [abs(-5)]{.literal} both return 5.
However, for complex numbers, it returns the magnitude:

\>\>\> [abs(z)]{.codestrong}\
3.605551275463989

The standard library's [cmath]{.literal} module ([cmath]{.literal} for
*complex math*) provides access to a number of other specialized
functions to work with complex numbers.

### []{#page_8}**Getting User Input** {#ch01lev1sec04 .h3}

As we start to write programs, it will help to have a nice, simple way
to accept user input via the [input()]{.literal} function. That way, we
can write programs that ask a user to input a number, perform specific
operations on that number, and then display the results of the
operations. Let's see it in action:

[➊]{.ent} \>\>\> [a = input()]{.codestrong}\
[➋]{.ent} 1

At [➊]{.ent}, we call the [input()]{.literal} function, which waits for
you to type something, as shown at [➋]{.ent}, and press [ENTER]{.small}.
The input provided is stored in [a]{.literal}:

   \>\>\> [a]{.codestrong}\
[➌]{.ent} \'1\'

Notice the single quotes around 1 at [➌]{.ent}. The [input()]{.literal}
function returns the input as a *string*. In Python, a string is any set
of characters between two quotes. When you want to create a string,
either single quotes or double quotes can be used:

\>\>\> [s1 = \'a string\']{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [s2 = \"a string\"]{.codestrong}

Here, both [s1]{.literal} and [s2]{.literal} refer to the same string.

Even if the only characters in a string are numbers, Python won't treat
that string as a number unless we get rid of those quotation marks. So
before we can perform any mathematical operations with the input, we'll
have to convert it into the correct number type. A string can be
converted to an integer or floating point number using the
[int()]{.literal} or [float()]{.literal} function, respectively:

\>\>\> [a = \'1\']{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [int(a) + 1]{.codestrong}\
2\
\>\>\> [float(a) + 1]{.codestrong}\
2.0

These are the same [int()]{.literal} and [float()]{.literal} functions
we saw earlier, but this time instead of converting the input from one
kind of number to another, they take a string as input
([\'1\']{.literal}) and return a number ([1]{.literal} or
[1.0]{.literal}). It's important to note, however, that the
[int()]{.literal} function cannot convert a string containing a floating
point decimal into an integer. If you take a string that has a floating
point number (like [\'2.5\']{.literal} or even [\'2.0\']{.literal}) and
input that string into the [int()]{.literal} function, you'll get an
error message:

\>\>\> [int(\'2.0\')]{.codestrong}\
Traceback (most recent call last):\
[]{#page_9}\
  File \"\<pyshell\#26\>\", line 1, in \<module\>\
    int(\'2.0\')\
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: \'2.0\'

This is an example of an *exception*---Python's way of telling you that
it cannot continue executing your program because of an error. In this
case, the exception is of the type [ValueError]{.literal}. (For a quick
refresher on exceptions, see [Appendix B](app02.html#app02).)

Similarly, when you supply a fractional number such as 3/4 as an input,
Python cannot convert it into an equivalent floating point number or
integer. Once again, a [ValueError]{.literal} exception is raised:

\>\>\> [a = float(input())]{.codestrong}\
3/4\
Traceback (most recent call last):\
  File \"\<pyshell\#25\>\", line 1, in \<module\>\
    a=float(input())\
ValueError: could not convert string to float: \'3/4\'

You may find it useful to perform the conversion in a
[try\...except]{.literal} block so that you can *handle* this exception
and alert the user that the program has encountered an invalid input.
We'll look at [try\...except]{.literal} blocks next.

#### ***Handling Exceptions and Invalid Input*** {#ch01lev2sec03 .h4}

If you're not familiar with [try\...except]{.literal}, the basic idea is
this: if you execute one or more statements in a
[try\...except]{.literal} block and there's an error while executing,
your program will not crash and print a [Traceback]{.literal}. Instead,
the execution is transferred to the [except]{.literal} block, where you
can perform an appropriate operation, for instance, printing a helpful
error message or trying something else.

This is how you would perform the above conversion in a
[try\...except]{.literal} block and print a helpful error message on
invalid input:

\>\>\> [try:]{.codestrong}\
        [a = float(input(\'Enter a number: \'))]{.codestrong}\
[except ValueError:]{.codestrong}\
        [print(\'You entered an invalid number\')]{.codestrong}

Note that we need to specify the type of exception we want to handle.
Here, we want to handle the [ValueError]{.literal} exception, so we
specify it as [except ValueError]{.literal}.

Now, when you give an invalid input, such as 3/4, it prints a helpful
error message, as shown at [➊]{.ent}:

   Enter a number: [3/4]{.codestrong}\
[➊]{.ent} You entered an invalid number

[]{#page_10}You can also specify a prompt with the [input()]{.literal}
function to tell the user what kind of input is expected. For example:

\>\>\> [a = input(\'Input an integer: \')]{.codestrong}

The user will now see the message hinting to enter an integer as input:

Input an integer: [1]{.codestrong}

In many programs in this book, we'll ask the user to enter a number as
input, so we'll have to make sure we take care of conversion before we
attempt to perform any operations on these numbers. You can combine the
input and conversion in a single statement, as follows:

\>\>\> [a = int(input())]{.codestrong}\
1\
\>\>\> [a + 1]{.codestrong}\
2

This works great if the user inputs an integer. But as we saw earlier,
if the input is a floating point number (even one that's equivalent to
an integer, like 1.0), this will produce an error:

\>\>\> [a = int(input())]{.codestrong}\
[1.0]{.codestrong}\
Traceback (most recent call last):\
  File \"\<pyshell\#42\>\", line 1, in \<module\>\
    a=int(input())\
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: \'1.0\'

In order to avoid this error, we could set up a [ValueError]{.literal}
catch like the one we saw earlier for fractions. That way the program
would catch floating point numbers, which won't work in a program meant
for integers. However, it would also flag numbers like 1.0 and 2.0,
which Python *sees* as floating point numbers but that are equivalent to
integers and would work just fine if they were entered as the right
Python type.

To get around all this, we will use the [is\_integer()]{.literal} method
to filter out any numbers with a significant digit after the decimal
point. (This method is only defined for [float]{.literal} type numbers
in Python; it won't work with numbers that are already entered in
integer form.)

Here's an example:

\>\>\> [1.1.is\_integer()]{.codestrong}\
False

Here, we call the method [is\_integer()]{.literal} to check if 1.1 is an
integer, and the result is [False]{.literal} because 1.1 really is a
floating point number. On the other []{#page_11}hand, when the method is
called with 1.0 as the floating point number, the result is
[True]{.literal}:

\>\>\> [1.0.is\_integer()]{.codestrong}\
True

We can use [is\_integer()]{.literal} to filter out noninteger input
while keeping inputs like 1.0, which is expressed as a floating point
number but is equivalent to an integer. We'll see how the method would
fit into a larger program a bit later.

#### ***Fractions and Complex Numbers as Input*** {#ch01lev2sec04 .h4}

The [Fraction]{.literal} class we learned about earlier is also capable
of converting a string such as [\'3/4\']{.literal} to a
[Fraction]{.literal} object. In fact, this is how we can accept a
fraction as an input:

\>\>\> [a = Fraction(input(\'Enter a fraction: \'))]{.codestrong}\
Enter a fraction: [3/4]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [a]{.codestrong}\
Fraction(3, 4)

Try entering a fraction such as 3/0 as input:

\>\>\> [a = Fraction(input(\'Enter a fraction: \'))]{.codestrong}\
Enter a fraction: [3/0]{.codestrong}\
Traceback (most recent call last):\
  File \"\<pyshell\#2\>\", line 1, in \<module\>\
    a = Fraction(input(\'Enter a fraction: \'))\
  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.3/fractions.py\", line 167, in \_\_new\_\_\
    raise ZeroDivisionError(\'Fraction(%s, 0)\' % numerator)\
ZeroDivisionError: Fraction(3, 0)

The [ZeroDivisionError]{.literal} exception message tells you (as you
already know) that a fraction with a denominator of 0 is invalid. If
you're planning on having users enter fractions as input in one of your
programs, it's a good idea to always catch such exceptions. Here is how
you can do something like that:

\>\>\> [try:]{.codestrong}\
        [a = Fraction(input(\'Enter a fraction: \'))\
except ZeroDivisionError:]{.codestrong}\
        [print(\'Invalid fraction\')]{.codestrong}\
\
Enter a fraction: [3/0]{.codestrong}\
Invalid fraction

Now, whenever your program's user enters a fraction with 0 in the
denominator, it'll print the message [Invalid fraction]{.literal}.

[]{#page_12}Similarly, the [complex()]{.literal} function can convert a
string such as [\'2+3j\']{.literal} into a complex number:

\>\>\> [z = complex(input(\'Enter a complex number: \'))]{.codestrong}\
Enter a complex number: [2+3j]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [z]{.codestrong}\
(2+3j)

If you enter the string as [\'2 + 3j\']{.literal} (with spaces), it will
result in a [ValueError]{.literal} error message:

\>\>\> [z = complex(input(\'Enter a complex number: \'))]{.codestrong}\
Enter a complex number: [2 + 3j]{.codestrong}\
Traceback (most recent call last):\
  File \"\<pyshell\#43\>\", line 1, in \<module\>\
    z = complex(input(\'Enter a complex number: \'))\
ValueError: complex() arg is a malformed string

It's a good idea to catch the [ValueError]{.literal} exception when
converting a string to a complex number, as we've done for other number
types.

### **Writing Programs That Do the Math for You** {#ch01lev1sec05 .h3}

Now that we have learned some of the basic concepts, we can combine them
with Python's conditional and looping statements to make some programs
that are a little more advanced and useful.

#### ***Calculating the Factors of an Integer*** {#ch01lev2sec05 .h4}

When a nonzero integer, [a]{.literal}, divides another integer,
[b]{.literal}, leaving a remainder 0, [a]{.literal} is said to be a
*factor* of [b]{.literal}. As an example, 2 is a factor of all even
integers. We can write a function such as the one below to find whether
a nonzero integer, [a]{.literal}, is a factor of another integer,
[b]{.literal}:

\>\>\> [def is\_factor(a, b):]{.codestrong}\
        [if b % a == 0:]{.codestrong}\
            [return True]{.codestrong}\
        [else:]{.codestrong}\
            [return False]{.codestrong}

We use the [%]{.literal} operator introduced earlier in this chapter to
calculate the remainder. If you ever find yourself asking a question
like "Is 4 a factor of 1024?", you can use the [is\_factor()]{.literal}
function:

\>\>\> [is\_factor(4, 1024)]{.codestrong}\
True

For any positive integer *n*, how do we find all its positive factors?
For each of the integers between 1 and *n*, we check the remainder after
dividing *n* by this integer. If it leaves a remainder of 0, it's a
factor. We'll use the []{#page_13}[range()]{.literal} function to write
a program that will go through each of those numbers between 1 and *n*.

Before we write the full program, let's take a look at how
[range()]{.literal} works. A typical use of the [range()]{.literal}
function looks like this:

\>\>\> [for i in range(1, 4):]{.codestrong}\
        [print(i)]{.codestrong}\
1\
2\
3

Here, we set up a [for]{.literal} loop and gave the range function two
arguments. The [range()]{.literal} function starts from the integer
stated as the first argument (the *start value*) and continues up to the
integer just *before* the one stated by the second argument (the *stop
value*). In this case, we told Python to print out the numbers in that
range, beginning with 1 and stopping at 4. Note that this means Python
doesn't print 4, so the last number it prints is the number before the
stop value (3). It's also important to note that the [range()]{.literal}
function accepts only integers as its arguments.

You can also use the [range()]{.literal} function without specifying the
start value, in which case it's assumed to be 0. For example:

\>\>\> [for i in range(5):]{.codestrong}\
        [print(i)]{.codestrong}\
0\
1\
2\
3\
4

The difference between two consecutive integers produced by the
[range()]{.literal} function is known as the *step value*. By default,
the step value is 1. To specify a different step value, specify it as
the third argument (the start value is *not* optional when you specify a
step value). For example, the following program prints the odd numbers
*below* 10:

\>\>\> [for i in range(1,10,2):]{.codestrong}\
        [print(i)]{.codestrong}\
1\
3\
5\
7\
9

Okay, now that we see how the [range()]{.literal} function works, we're
ready to look at a factor-calculating program. Because I'm writing a
fairly long program, instead of writing this program in the interactive
IDLE prompt, I write it in the IDLE editor. You can start the editor by
selecting **File**[▸]{.ent}**New Window** in IDLE. Notice that we start
out by commenting our code with []{#page_14}three straight single quotes
([\']{.literal}). The text in between those quotes won't be executed by
Python as part of the program; it's just commentary for us humans.

   \'\'\'\
   Find the factors of an integer\
   \'\'\'\
\
   def factors(b):\
\
[➊]{.ent}     for i in range(1, b+1):\
           if b % i == 0:\
               print(i)\
\
   if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
\
       b = input(\'Your Number Please: \')\
       b = float(b)\
\
[➋]{.ent}     if b \> 0 and b.is\_integer():\
           factors(int(b))\
       else:\
           print(\'Please enter a positive integer\')

The [factors()]{.literal} function defines a [for]{.literal} loop that
iterates once for every integer between 1 and the input integer at
[➊]{.ent} using the [range()]{.literal} function. Here, we want to
iterate up to the integer entered by the user, [b]{.literal}, so the
stop value is stated as [b+1]{.literal}. For each of these integers,
[i]{.literal}, the program checks whether it divides the input number
with no remainder and prints it if so.

When you run this program (by selecting **Run**[▸]{.ent}**Run Module**),
it asks you to input a number. If your number is a positive integer, its
factors are printed. For example:

Your Number Please: [25]{.codestrong}\
1\
5\
25

If you enter a non-integer or a negative integer as an input, the
program prints an error message asking you to input a positive integer:

Your Number Please: [15.5]{.codestrong}\
Please enter a positive integer

This is an example of how we can make programs more user friendly by
always checking for invalid input in the program itself. Because our
program works only for finding the factors of a positive integer, we
check whether the input number is greater than 0 and is an integer using
the [is\_integer()]{.literal} method [➋]{.ent} to make sure the input is
valid. If the input isn't a positive integer, the program prints a
user-friendly instruction instead of just a big error message.

#### []{#page_15}***Generating Multiplication Tables*** {#ch01lev2sec06 .h4}

Consider three numbers, *a*, *b*, and *n*, where *n* is an integer, such
that

*a* × *n* = *b*.

We can say here that *b* is the *n*th *multiple* of *a*. For example, 4
is the 2nd multiple of 2, and 1024 is the 512nd multiple of 2.

A multiplication table for a number lists all of that number's
multiples. For example, the multiplication table of 2 looks like this
(first three multiples shown here):

2 × 1 = 2

2 × 2 = 4

2 × 3 = 6

Our next program generates the multiplication number up to 10 for any
number input by the user. In this program, we'll use the
[format()]{.literal} method with the [print()]{.literal} function to
help make the program's output look nicer and more readable. In case you
haven't seen it before, I'll now briefly explain how it works.

The [format()]{.literal} method lets you plug in labels and set it up so
that they get printed out in a nice, readable string with extra
formatting around it. For example, if I had the names of all the fruits
I bought at the grocery store with separate labels created for each and
wanted to print them out to make a coherent sentence, I could use the
[format()]{.literal} method as follows:

\>\>\> [item1 = \'apples\']{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [item2 = \'bananas\']{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [item3 = \'grapes\']{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [print(\'At the grocery store, I bought some {0} and {1} and {2}\'.format(item1, item2, item3))]{.codestrong}\
At the grocery store, I bought some apples and bananas and grapes

First, we created three labels ([item1]{.literal}, [item2]{.literal},
and [item3]{.literal}), each referring to a different string
([apples]{.literal}, [bananas]{.literal}, and [grapes]{.literal}). Then,
in the [print()]{.literal} function, we typed a string with three
placeholders in curly brackets: [{0}]{.literal}, [{1}]{.literal}, and
[{2}]{.literal}. We followed this with [.format()]{.literal}, which
holds the three labels we created. This tells Python to fill those three
placeholders with the values stored in those labels in the order listed,
so Python prints the text with [{0}]{.literal} replaced by the first
label, [{1}]{.literal} replaced by the second label, and so on.

It's not necessary to have labels pointing to the values we want to
print. We can also just type values into [.format()]{.literal}, as in
the following example:

\>\>\> [print(\'Number 1: {0} Number 2: {1} \'.format(1, 3.578))]{.codestrong}\
Number 1: 1 Number 2: 3.578

Note that the number of placeholders and the number of labels or values
must be equal.

[]{#page_16}Now that we've seen how [format()]{.literal} works, we're
ready to take a look at the program for our multiplication table
printer:

   \'\'\'\
   Multiplication table printer\
   \'\'\'\
\
   def multi\_table(a):\
\
[➊]{.ent}     for i in range(1, 11):\
           print(\'{0} x {1} = {2}\'.format(a, i, a\*i))\
\
   if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
       a = input(\'Enter a number: \')\
       multi\_table(float(a))

The function [multi\_table()]{.literal} implements the main
functionality of the program. It takes the number for which the
multiplication table will be printed as a parameter, [a]{.literal}.
Because we want to print the multiplication table from 1 to 10, we have
a [for]{.literal} loop at [➊]{.ent} that iterates over each of these
numbers, printing the product of itself and the number, [a]{.literal}.

When you execute the program, it asks you to input a number, and the
program prints its multiplication table:

Enter a number : [5]{.codestrong}\
5.0 x 1 = 5.0\
5.0 x 2 = 10.0\
5.0 x 3 = 15.0\
5.0 x 4 = 20.0\
5.0 x 5 = 25.0\
5.0 x 6 = 30.0\
5.0 x 7 = 35.0\
5.0 x 8 = 40.0\
5.0 x 9 = 45.0\
5.0 x 10 = 50.0

See how nice and orderly that table looks? That's because we used the
[.format()]{.literal} method to print the output according to a
readable, uniform template.

You can use the [format()]{.literal} method to further control how
numbers are printed. For example, if you want numbers with only two
decimal places, you can specify that with the [format()]{.literal}
method. Here is an example:

\>\>\> [\'{0}\'.format(1.25456)]{.codestrong}\
\'1.25456\'\
\>\>\> [\'{0:.2f}\'.format(1.25456)]{.codestrong}\
\'1.25\'

The first format statement above simply prints the number exactly as we
entered it. In the second statement, we modify the place holder to
[{0:.2f}]{.literal}, []{#page_17}meaning that we want only two numbers
after the decimal point, with the [f]{.literal} indicating a floating
point number. As you can see, there are only two numbers after the
decimal point in the next output. Note that the number is rounded if
there are more numbers after the decimal point than you specified. For
example:

\>\>\> [\'{0:.2f}\'.format(1.25556)]{.codestrong}\
\'1.26\'

Here, 1.25556 is rounded up to the nearest hundredth and printed as
1.26. If you use [.2f]{.literal} and the number you are printing is an
integer, zeros are added at the end:

\>\>\> [\'{0:.2f}\'.format(1)]{.codestrong}\
\'1.00\'

Two zeros are added because we specified that we should print exactly
two numbers after the decimal point.

#### ***Converting Units of Measurement*** {#ch01lev2sec07 .h4}

The International System of Units defines seven *base quantities*. These
are then used to derive other quantities, referred to as *derived
quantities*. Length (including width, height, and depth), time, mass,
and temperature are four of the seven base quantities. Each of these
quantities has a standard unit of measurement: meter, second, kilogram,
and kelvin, respectively.

But each of these standard measurement units also has multiple
nonstandard measurement units. You are more familiar with the
temperature being reported as 30 degrees Celsius or 86 degrees
Fahrenheit than as 303.15 kelvin. Does that mean 303.15 kelvin feels
three times hotter than 86 degrees Fahrenheit? No way! We can't compare
86 degrees Fahrenheit to 303.15 kelvin only by their numerical values
because they're expressed in different measurement units, even though
they measure the same physical quantity---temperature. You can compare
two measurements of a physical quantity only when they're expressed in
the same unit of measurement.

Conversions between different units of measurement can be tricky, and
that's why you're often asked to solve problems that involve conversion
between different units of measurement in high school. It's a good way
to test your basic mathematical skills. But Python has plenty of math
skills, too, and, unlike some high school students, it doesn't get tired
of crunching numbers over and over again in a loop! Next, we'll explore
writing programs to perform those unit conversions for you.

We'll start with length. In the United States and United Kingdom, inches
and miles are often used for measuring length, while most other
countries use centimeters and kilometers.

An inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters, and you can use the multiplication
operation to convert a measurement in inches to centimeters. You can
then []{#page_18}divide the measurement in centimeters by 100 to obtain
the measurement in meters. For example, here's how you can convert 25.5
inches to meters:

\>\>\> [(25.5 \* 2.54) / 100]{.codestrong}\
0.6476999999999999

On the other hand, a mile is roughly equivalent to 1.609 kilometers. So
if you see that your destination is 650 miles away, you're 650 × 1.609
kilometers away:

\>\>\> [650 \* 1.609]{.codestrong}\
1045.85

Now let's take a look at *temperature* conversion---converting
temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Temperature
expressed in Fahrenheit is converted into its equivalent value in
Celsius using the formula

::: {.image2}
![image](graphics/e0018-01.jpg)
:::

*F* is the temperature in Fahrenheit, and *C* is its equivalent in
Celsius. You know that 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is said to be the normal
human body temperature. To find the corresponding temperature in degrees
Celsius, we evaluate the above formula in Python:

\>\>\> [F = 98.6]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [(F - 32) \* (5 / 9)]{.codestrong}\
37.0

First, we create a label, [F]{.literal}, with the temperature in
Fahrenheit, 98.6. Next, we evaluate the formula for converting this
temperature to its equivalent in Celsius, which turns out be 37.0
degrees Celsius.

To convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you would use the
formula

::: {.image2}
![image](graphics/e0018-02.jpg)
:::

You can evaluate this formula in a similar manner:

\>\>\> [C = 37]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [C \* (9 / 5) + 32]{.codestrong}\
98.60000000000001

We create a label, [C]{.literal}, with the value 37 (the normal human
body temperature in Celsius). Then, we convert it into Fahrenheit using
the formula, and the result is 98.6 degrees.

It's a chore to have to write these conversion formulas over and over
again. Let's write a unit conversion program that will do the
conversions []{#page_19}for us. This program will present a menu to
allow users to select the conversion they want to perform, ask for
relevant input, and then print the calculated result. The program is
shown below:

   \'\'\'\
   Unit converter: Miles and Kilometers\
   \'\'\'\
\
   def print\_menu():\
       print(\'1. Kilometers to Miles\')\
       print(\'2. Miles to Kilometers\')\
\
   def km\_miles():\
       km = float(input(\'Enter distance in kilometers: \'))\
       miles = km / 1.609\
\
       print(\'Distance in miles: {0}\'.format(miles))\
\
   def miles\_km():\
       miles = float(input(\'Enter distance in miles: \'))\
       km = miles \* 1.609\
\
       print(\'Distance in kilometers: {0}\'.format(km))\
\
   if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
[➊]{.ent}     print\_menu()\
[➋]{.ent}     choice = input(\'Which conversion would you like to do?: \')\
       if choice == \'1\':\
           km\_miles()\
\
       if choice == \'2\':\
           miles\_km()

This is a slightly longer program than the others, but not to worry.
It's actually simple. Let's start from [➊]{.ent}. The
[print\_menu()]{.literal} function is called, which prints a menu with
two unit conversion choices. At [➋]{.ent}, the user is asked to select
one of the two conversions. If the choice is entered as 1 (kilometers to
miles), the function [km\_miles()]{.literal} is called. If the choice is
entered as 2 (miles to kilometers), the function [miles\_km()]{.literal}
is called. In both of these functions, the user is first asked to enter
a distance in the unit chosen for conversion (kilometers for
[km\_miles()]{.literal} and miles for [miles\_km()]{.literal}). The
program then performs the conversion using the corresponding formula and
displays the result.

Here is a sample run of the program:

   1. Kilometers to Miles\
   2. Miles to Kilometers\
[➊]{.ent} Which conversion would you like to do?: [2]{.codestrong}\
   Enter distance in miles: [100]{.codestrong}\
   Distance in kilometers: 160.900000

[]{#page_20}The user is asked to enter a choice at [➊]{.ent}. The choice
is entered as 2 (miles to kilometers). The program then asks the user to
enter the distance in miles to be converted to kilometers and prints the
conversion.

This program just converts between miles and kilometers, but in a
programming challenge later, you'll extend this program so that it can
perform conversions of other units.

#### ***Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Equation*** {#ch01lev2sec08 .h4}

What do you do when you have an equation such as *x* + 500 -- 79 = 10
and you need to find the value of the unknown variable, *x*? You
rearrange the terms such that you have only the constants (500, --79,
and 10) on one side of the equation and the variable (*x*) on the other
side. This results in the following equation: *x* = 10 -- 500 + 79.

Finding the value of the expression on the right gives you the value of
*x*, your solution, which is also called the *root* of this equation. In
Python, you can do this as follows:

\>\>\> [x = 10 - 500 + 79]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [x]{.codestrong}\
-411

This is an example of a *linear equation*. Once you have rearranged the
terms on both sides, the expression is simple enough to evaluate. On the
other hand, for equations such as *x*^2^ + 2*x* + 1 = 0, finding the
roots of *x* usually involves evaluating a complex expression known as
the *quadratic formula*. Such equations are known as *quadratic
equations*, generally expressed as *ax*^2^ + *bx* + *c* = 0, where *a*,
*b*, and *c* are constants. The quadratic formula for calculating the
roots is given as follows:

::: {.image2}
![image](graphics/e0020-01.jpg)
:::

A quadratic equation has two roots---two values of *x* for which the two
sides of the quadratic equation are equal (although sometimes these two
values may turn out to be the same). This is indicated here by the
*x*~1~ and *x*~2~ in the quadratic formula.

Comparing the equation *x*^2^ + 2*x* + 1 = 0 to the generic quadratic
equation, we see that *a* = 1, *b* = 2, and *c* = 1. We can substitute
these values directly into the quadratic formula to calculate the value
of *x*~1~ and *x*~2~. In Python, we first store the values of *a*, *b*,
and *c* as the labels [a]{.literal}, [b]{.literal}, and [c]{.literal}
with the appropriate values:

\>\>\> [a = 1]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [b = 2]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [c = 1]{.codestrong}

[]{#page_21}Then, considering that both the formulas have the term
*b*^2^ -- 4*ac*, we'll define a new label with *D*, such that
![image](graphics/e0021-01.jpg):

\>\>\> [D = (b\*\*2 -- 4\*a\*c)\*\*0.5]{.codestrong}

As you can see, we evaluate the square root of *b*^2^ -- 4*ac* by
raising it to the 0.5th power. Now, we can write the expressions for
evaluating *x*~1~ and *x*~2~:

\>\>\> [x\_1 = (-b + D)/(2\*a)]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [x\_1]{.codestrong}\
-1.0\
\>\>\> [x\_2 = (-b - D)/(2\*a)]{.codestrong}\
\>\>\> [x\_2]{.codestrong}\
-1.0

In this case, the values of both the roots are the same, and if you
substitute that value into the equation *x*^2^ + 2*x* + 1, the equation
will evaluate to 0.

Our next program combines all these steps in a function
[roots()]{.literal}, which takes the values of *a*, *b*, and *c* as
parameters, calculates the roots, and prints them:

\'\'\'\
Quadratic equation root calculator\
\'\'\'\
\
def roots(a, b, c):\
\
    D = (b\*b - 4\*a\*c)\*\*0.5\
    x\_1 = (-b + D)/(2\*a)\
    x\_2 = (-b - D)/(2\*a)\
\
    print(\'x1: {0}\'.format(x\_1))\
    print(\'x2: {0}\'.format(x\_2))\
\
if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
    a = input(\'Enter a: \')\
    b = input(\'Enter b: \')\
    c = input(\'Enter c: \')\
    roots(float(a), float(b), float(c))

At first, we use the labels [a]{.literal}, [b]{.literal}, and
[c]{.literal} to reference the values of the three constants of a
quadratic equation. Then, we call the [roots()]{.literal} function with
these three values as arguments (after converting them to floating point
numbers). This function plugs [a]{.literal}, [b]{.literal}, and
[c]{.literal} into the quadratic formula, finds the roots for that
equation, and prints them.

When you execute the program, it will ask the user to input values of
*a*, *b*, and *c* corresponding to a quadratic equation they want to
find the roots for.

Enter a: [1]{.codestrong}\
Enter b: [2]{.codestrong}\
Enter c: [1]{.codestrong}\
[]{#page_22}\
x1: -1.000000\
x2: -1.000000

Try solving a few more quadratic equations with different values for the
constants, and the program will find the roots correctly.

You most likely know that quadratic equations can have complex numbers
as roots, too. For example, the roots of the equation *x*^2^ + *x* + 1 =
0 are both complex numbers. The above program can find those for you as
well. Let's give it a shot by executing the program again (the constants
are *a* = 1, *b* = 1, and *c* = 1):

Enter a: [1]{.codestrong}\
Enter b: [1]{.codestrong}\
Enter c: [1]{.codestrong}\
x1: (-0.49999999999999994+0.8660254037844386j)\
x2: (-0.5-0.8660254037844386j)

The roots printed above are complex numbers (indicated by
[j]{.literal}), and the program has no problem calculating or displaying
them.

### **What You Learned** {#ch01lev1sec06 .h3}

Great work on finishing the first chapter! You learned to write programs
that recognize integers, floating point numbers, fractional numbers
(expressed as a fraction or a floating point number), and complex
numbers. You wrote programs that generate multiplication tables, perform
unit conversions, and find the roots of a quadratic equation. I'm sure
you're already excited about having taken the first steps toward writing
programs that will do mathematical calculations for you. Before we move
on, here are some programming challenges that will give you a chance to
further apply what you've learned.

### **[Programming Challenges]{.bordera}** {#ch01lev1sec07 .h3}

Here are a few challenges that will give you a chance to practice the
concepts from this chapter. Each problem can be solved in multiple ways,

#### ***\#1: Even-Odd Vending Machine*** {#ch01lev2sec09 .h4}

Try writing an "even-odd vending machine," which will take a number as
input and do two things:

1\. Print whether the number is even or odd.

2\. Display the number followed by the next 9 even or odd numbers.

If the input is [2]{.literal}, the program should print [even]{.literal}
and then print [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]{.literal}.
Similarly, if the input is [1]{.literal}, the program should print
[odd]{.literal} and then print [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17,
19]{.literal}.

[]{#page_23}Your program should use the [is\_integer()]{.literal} method
to display an error message if the input is a number with significant
digits beyond the decimal point.

#### ***\#2: Enhanced Multiplication Table Generator*** {#ch01lev2sec10 .h4}

Our multiplication table generator is cool, but it prints only the first
10 multiples. Enhance the generator so that the user can specify both
the number and up to *which* multiple. For example, I should be able to
input that I want to see a table listing the first 15 multiples of 9.

#### ***\#3: Enhanced Unit Converter*** {#ch01lev2sec11 .h4}

The unit conversion program we wrote in this chapter is limited to
conversions between kilometers and miles. Try extending the program to
convert between units of mass (such as kilograms and pounds) and between
units of temperature (such as Celsius and Fahrenheit).

#### ***\#4: Fraction Calculator*** {#ch01lev2sec12 .h4}

Write a calculator that can perform the basic mathematical operations on
two fractions. It should ask the user for two fractions and the
operation the user wants to carry out. As a head start, here's how you
can write the program with only the addition operation:

   \'\'\'\
   Fraction operations\
   \'\'\'\
   from fractions import Fraction\
\
   def add(a, b):\
       print(\'Result of Addition: {0}\'.format(a+b))\
\
   if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
[➊]{.ent}     a = Fraction(input(\'Enter first fraction: \'))\
[➋]{.ent}     b = Fraction(input(\'Enter second fraction: \'))\
       op = input(\'Operation to perform - Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiply: \')\
       if op == \'Add\':\
           add(a,b)

You've already seen most of the elements in this program. At [➊]{.ent}
and [➋]{.ent}, we ask the user to input the two fractions. Then, we ask
the user which operation is to be performed on the two fractions. If the
user enters [\'Add\']{.literal} as input, we call the function
[add()]{.literal}, which we've defined to find the sum of the two
fractions passed as arguments. The [add()]{.literal} function performs
the operation and prints the result. For example:

Enter first fraction: [3/4]{.codestrong}\
Enter second fraction: [1/4]{.codestrong}\
Operation to perform - Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiply: [Add]{.codestrong}\
Result of Addition: 1

[]{#page_24}Try adding support for other operations such as subtraction,
division, and multiplication. For example, here's how your program
should be able to calculate the difference of two fractions:

Enter first fraction: [3/4]{.codestrong}\
Enter second fraction: [1/4]{.codestrong}\
Operation to perform - Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiply: [Subtract]{.codestrong}\
Result of Subtraction: 2/4

In the case of division, you should let the user know whether the first
fraction is divided by the second fraction or vice versa.

#### ***\#5: Give Exit Power to the User*** {#ch01lev2sec13 .h4}

All the programs we have written so far work only for one iteration of
input and output. For example, consider the program to print the
multiplication table: the user executes the program and enters a number;
then the program prints the multiplication table and exits. If the user
wanted to print the multiplication table of another number, the program
would have to be rerun.

It would be more convenient if the user could choose whether to exit or
continue using the program. The key to writing such programs is to set
up an *infinite loop*, or a loop that doesn't exit unless explicitly
asked to do so. Below, you can see an example of the layout for such a
program:

   \'\'\'\
   Run until exit layout\
   \'\'\'\
\
   def fun():\
       print(\'I am in an endless loop\')\
\
   if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
[➊]{.ent}     while True:\
           fun()\
[➋]{.ent}         answer = input(\'Do you want to exit? (y) for yes \')\
           if answer == \'y\':\
               break

We define an infinite loop using [while True]{.literal} at [➊]{.ent}. A
[while]{.literal} loop continues to execute unless the condition
evaluates to [False]{.literal}. Because we chose the loop's condition to
be the constant value [True]{.literal}, it will keep running forever
unless we interrupt it somehow. Inside the loop, we call the function
[fun()]{.literal}, which prints the string [I am in an endless
loop]{.literal}. At [➋]{.ent}, the user is asked "Do you want to exit?"
If the user enters [y]{.literal} as the input, the program exits out of
the loop using the [break]{.literal} statement ([break]{.literal} exits
out of the innermost loop without executing any other statement in that
loop). If the user enters any other input (or none at all, just pressing
[ENTER]{.small}), the [while]{.literal} loop continues
[]{#page_25}execution---that is, it prints the string again and
continues doing so until the user wishes to exit. Here is a sample run
of the program:

I am in an endless loop\
Do you want to exit? (y) for yes [n]{.codestrong}\
I am in an endless loop\
Do you want to exit? (y) for yes [n]{.codestrong}\
I am in an endless loop\
Do you want to exit? (y) for yes [n]{.codestrong}\
I am in an endless loop\
Do you want to exit? (y) for yes [y]{.codestrong}

Based on this example, let's rewrite the multiplication table generator
so that it keeps going until the user wants to exit. The new version of
the program is shown below:

\'\'\'\
Multiplication table printer with\
exit power to the user\
\'\'\'\
\
def multi\_table(a):\
\
    for i in range(1, 11):\
        print(\'{0} x {1} = {2}\'.format(a, i, a\*i))\
\
if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':\
\
\
    [while True:]{.codestrong}\
        a = input(\'Enter a number: \')\
        multi\_table(float(a))\
\
        [answer = input(\'Do you want to exit? (y) for yes \')]{.codestrong}\
        [if answer == \'y\':]{.codestrong}\
            [break]{.codestrong}

If you compare this program to the one we wrote earlier, you'll see that
the only change is the addition of the [while]{.literal} loop, which
includes the prompt asking the user to input a number and the call to
the [multi\_table()]{.literal} function.

When you run the program, the program will ask for a number and print
its multiplication table, as before. However, it will also subsequently
ask whether the user wants to exit the program. If the user doesn't want
to exit, the program will be ready to print the table for another
number. Here is a sample run:

Enter a number: [2]{.codestrong}\
2.000000 x 1.000000 = 2.000000\
2.000000 x 2.000000 = 4.000000\
2.000000 x 3.000000 = 6.000000\
2.000000 x 4.000000 = 8.000000\
[]{#page_26}\
2.000000 x 5.000000 = 10.000000\
2.000000 x 6.000000 = 12.000000\
2.000000 x 7.000000 = 14.000000\
2.000000 x 8.000000 = 16.000000\
2.000000 x 9.000000 = 18.000000\
2.000000 x 10.000000 = 20.000000\
Do you want to exit? (y) for yes [n]{.codestrong}\
Enter a number:

Try rewriting some of the other programs in this chapter so that they
continue executing until asked by the user to exit.
