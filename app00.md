You've reached the end of the book--- nice work! Now that you've learned
how to handle numbers, generate graphs, apply mathematical operations,
manipulate sets and algebraic expressions, create animated
visualizations, and solve calculus problems---whew!---what should you do
next? Here are a few things to try.[^1^](footnote.html#fn06){#fn_06}

### **Things to Explore Next** {#app00lev1sec01 .h3}

It's my hope that this book inspires you to go solve your own
mathematical questions. But it's often difficult to think up such
challenges on your own.

#### []{#page_210}***Project Euler*** {#app00lev2sec01 .h4}

One definitive place to look for math problems that require you to
implement programming solutions is Project Euler
(*<https://projecteuler.net/>*), which offers more than 500 math
problems of varying difficulty. Once you create a free account, you can
submit your solutions to check whether they are correct.

#### ***Python Documentation*** {#app00lev2sec02 .h4}

You may also wish to start exploring Python's documentation of various
features.

• The Math Module: *<https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html>*

• Other Numeric and Mathematical Modules:
*<https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html>*

• The Statistics Module:
*<https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html>*

We didn't discuss how floating point numbers are stored in a computer's
memory or the problems and errors that may arise as a result. You may
want to look at the decimal module's documentation and the discussion on
"Floating Point Arithmetic" in the Python tutorial to learn about this
topic:

• The Decimal Module: *<https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html>*

• Floating Point Arithmetic:
*<https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/floatingpoint.html>*

#### ***Books*** {#app00lev2sec03 .h4}

If you're interested in exploring more math and programming topics,
check out the following books:

• *Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python* and *Making Games with
Python and Pygame* by Al Sweigart (both freely available at
*<https://inventwithpython.com/>*) don't specifically address solving
math problems but apply math for the purpose of writing computer games
using Python.

• *Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers* by Allen B.
Downey is a freely available book
(*<http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/>*). As the title suggests, it
delves deeply into statistics and probability topics beyond the ones
discussed in this book.

• *Teach Your Kids to Code* by Bryson Payne (No Starch Press, 2015) is
meant for beginners and covers various Python topics. You'll learn
turtle graphics, various interesting ways of using the
[random]{.literal} Python module, and how to create games and animations
using Pygame.

[]{#page_211}• *Computational Physics with Python* by Mark Newman (2013)
focuses on a number of advanced math topics geared toward solving
problems in physics. However, there are a number of chapters that are
relevant to anyone interested in learning more about writing programs
for solving numerical and mathematical problems.

### **Getting Help** {#app00lev1sec02 .h3}

If you are stuck on a specific issue discussed in this book, please
contact me via email at *<doingmathwithpython@gmail.com>*. If you want
to learn more about any of the functions or classes we have used in our
programs, the first place to look would be the official documentation of
the relevant projects:

• Python 3 standard library:
*<https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>*

• SymPy: *<http://docs.sympy.org/>*

• matplotlib: *<http://matplotlib.org/contents.html>*

If you are stuck with a problem and want help, you can also email the
project-specific mailing lists. You can find links to these on the
book's website.

### **Conclusion** {#app00lev1sec03 .h3}

And finally, we've reached the end of the book. I hope you've learned a
lot as you followed along. Go out there and solve some more problems
using Python![]{#page_212}
