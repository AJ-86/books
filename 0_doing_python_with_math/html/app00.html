<p class="noindent">You&#8217;ve reached the end of the book&#8212; nice work! Now that you&#8217;ve learned how to handle numbers, generate graphs, apply mathematical operations, manipulate sets and algebraic expressions, create animated visualizations, and solve calculus problems&#8212;whew!&#8212;what should you do next? Here are a few things to try.<a id="fn_06" href="footnote.html#fn06"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="h3" id="app00lev1sec01"><strong>Things to Explore Next</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s my hope that this book inspires you to go solve your own mathematical questions. But it&#8217;s often difficult to think up such challenges on your own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="app00lev2sec01"><a id="page_210"/><strong><em>Project Euler</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">One definitive place to look for math problems that require you to implement programming solutions is Project Euler (<em><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a></em>), which offers more than 500 math problems of varying difficulty. Once you create a free account, you can submit your solutions to check whether they are correct.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="app00lev2sec02"><strong><em>Python Documentation</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindentb">You may also wish to start exploring Python&#8217;s documentation of various features.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; The Math Module: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html</a></em></p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; Other Numeric and Mathematical Modules: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html</a></em></p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; The Statistics Module: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html</a></em></p>
<p class="indenttb">We didn&#8217;t discuss how floating point numbers are stored in a computer&#8217;s memory or the problems and errors that may arise as a result. You may want to look at the decimal module&#8217;s documentation and the discussion on &#8220;Floating Point Arithmetic&#8221; in the Python tutorial to learn about this topic:</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; The Decimal Module: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html</a></em></p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; Floating Point Arithmetic: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/floatingpoint.html">https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/floatingpoint.html</a></em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="app00lev2sec03"><strong><em>Books</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindentb">If you&#8217;re interested in exploring more math and programming topics, check out the following books:</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; <em>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</em> and <em>Making Games with Python and Pygame</em> by Al Sweigart (both freely available at <em><a href="https://inventwithpython.com/">https://inventwithpython.com/</a></em>) don&#8217;t specifically address solving math problems but apply math for the purpose of writing computer games using Python.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; <em>Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers</em> by Allen B. Downey is a freely available book (<em><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/">http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/</a></em>). As the title suggests, it delves deeply into statistics and probability topics beyond the ones discussed in this book.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; <em>Teach Your Kids to Code</em> by Bryson Payne (No Starch Press, 2015) is meant for beginners and covers various Python topics. You&#8217;ll learn turtle graphics, various interesting ways of using the <span class="literal">random</span> Python module, and how to create games and animations using Pygame.</p>
<p class="bull"><a id="page_211"/>&#8226; <em>Computational Physics with Python</em> by Mark Newman (2013) focuses on a number of advanced math topics geared toward solving problems in physics. However, there are a number of chapters that are relevant to anyone interested in learning more about writing programs for solving numerical and mathematical problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="app00lev1sec02"><strong>Getting Help</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">If you are stuck on a specific issue discussed in this book, please contact me via email at <em><a href="mailto:doingmathwithpython@gmail.com">doingmathwithpython@gmail.com</a></em>. If you want to learn more about any of the functions or classes we have used in our programs, the first place to look would be the official documentation of the relevant projects:</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; Python 3 standard library: <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html</a></em></p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; SymPy: <em><a href="http://docs.sympy.org/">http://docs.sympy.org/</a></em></p>
<p class="bull">&#8226; matplotlib: <em><a href="http://matplotlib.org/contents.html">http://matplotlib.org/contents.html</a></em></p>
<p class="indentt">If you are stuck with a problem and want help, you can also email the project-specific mailing lists. You can find links to these on the book&#8217;s website.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="app00lev1sec03"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p class="indentt">And finally, we&#8217;ve reached the end of the book. I hope you&#8217;ve learned a lot as you followed along. Go out there and solve some more problems using Python!<a id="page_212"/></p>
